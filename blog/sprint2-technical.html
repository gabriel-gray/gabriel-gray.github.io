                <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
            Imagine that you have a set of framed and matted photographs hanging on a wall. Each photo is surrounded by a mat that puts space between the photo and the frame. That space would be the padding.The frame encloses the mat and the image. That would be the border.Each picture has a set amount of space around the outside. 
            That is the margin. If two pictures are handing side by side with four inches between them, 
            then we might say that they each have a two inch margin. 
            The margin is the distance between an element and something else.In Web development it is particularly important to know the size of each if we are placing elements side by side within a parent container.

        <div class="example">
            <div>
                <img src="../images/example2.png" alt="example2, box model">
                <p>Example</p>
            </div>
        </div>
           
        <p>
            The image above is a box model, showing a box model with a margin, border and padding. The Outer blue box shows the margin, this is the amount of space around an object.The white box within the blue box is the border. 
            The border is between the margin and padding of an object.The orange box within the white box is the padding. 
            The padding defines how much space is within an object's sides and it's contents.As you can see from the above anology and the example image they all have their own, important role to play
