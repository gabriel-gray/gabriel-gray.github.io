            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. Some researchers suggest that emotional intelligence can be learned and strengthened, while others claim it is an inborn characteristic.
        </p>

        <p>The ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others. 
            Imagine a world in which you could not understand when a friend was feeling sad or when a co-worker was angry. Psychologists refer to this ability as emotional intelligence, and some experts even suggest that it can be more important than IQ in your overall success in life. </p>

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        
        <p>
            IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a number derived from an intelligence test. These scores were calculated by comparing the test takers score to the average scores of other people in the same group. IQ represents these abilities. 
        </p>

        <ul>
                <li>Visual and Spatial Processing</li>
                <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
                <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
                <li>Quantitative reasoning </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Emotional intelligence shows a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions. Emotional intelligence is centered on abilities such as: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying emotions</li>
            <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
            <li>Controlling one’s own emotions </li>
            <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
            <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
            <li>Relating to others</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As seen above, IQ shows more abilities in terms of taking on Tasks, EQ shows more emotional level thinking, making it much more valuable in a team environment where you’re working with other people, you’re able to be more concise with what people’s feelings and what they are thinking and saying. This makes EQ important in team environments; rather any environments where you are working with people.
