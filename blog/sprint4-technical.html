        <h2>An instance where I got blocked on a simple problem </h2>
        <p>
            Back when I was attempting the "Manipulating the DOM challenge" and I had reached the point where I had to make the invisible division visable. I spent so long trying to figure out what was wrong with my function I was using "getElementgsByClassName", I saw no reason why it wouldn't work. In the end it was due to me missing element [0] in the array. The second I added it it worked, I spent ages messing around with the code when I had missed one small thing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>An instance where I solved a problem in an elegant way </h2>
        
        <p>
           I found that after dealing with that issue with the "Coloured Dots in the DOM" task and moving through to the "Game Board in the DOM" task, I really breezed through it. I still had a pretty intense problem solving mindset, so immediately after reaading the task I was able to go through really quickly. After reaching the updatecounts function, I slowed down a little but I was able to understand what it was asking and utilise my knowledge writing the var count functions and what not. It felt super smooth after hitting a dead end with the previous challenge.
