        <h2>What are three new things I have learned about myself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        
        <p>
        I learned that I have a lack of confidence in myself, whenever I start one of the challenges given I start to feel a little overwhelmed. To overcome this I've learned to take things one step at a time. I have also noticed a change of mindset from a fixed mindset to a growth. I've felt ever since I've done the mindfullness every morning before I start has helped me stay focused much more, I think this has also helped me shift to a growth mindset.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        
        <p>
        These roles are important in learning and programming as a lot of the time, you would be working with people to work on a goal, so it's important that you're self aware and empathetic to people you're working with.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        
        <p>
            I was surpirsed at how much it has actually affected my mindset, looking back at myself before I started foundations; I feel like I have changed for the better quite a bit. While I was expecting a change, I didn't think it would effect me as much as it has.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        
        <p>
            I think becoming more self aware about myself and trying to change bad habits, getting into a routine with timeboxes and making sure I do mindfullness.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

        <p>
            To show it's not only knowledge about web development that's important, but core values and emotional intelligence are equally as important. So whenever we work with people, we have a great mindset prepped.
        </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

        <p>
            Not at all. As I stated above, this has helped me grow a lot as a person, it also helps prepare us for team working enviroments. It's equally as important as learning programming. 
        </p>

        <h1>Preparing For Bootcamp</h1>
        
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

        <p>After I've completed my course at Dev Academy I would love to start work in the industry and after COVID has died down, i'd love to work overseas in tech maybe as freelance? I would like to work and travel for a bit. </p>

        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

        <p> My biggest strength would be working as a team, I love working with people to achieve a common goal, I'm also very self aware so I'd be able to pick up on something off pretty fast. My biggest limitation would be the fact I can be a little too self aware, so I might begin to overthink things or judge myself over something insignificant.  

        </p>

        <h2> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

        <p>
           I'm definitely a bit anxious about jumping into bootcamp, the change of routine and how the overall bootcamp will be. I think overcoming the anxiety of the bootcamp is the biggest non-technical challenge for me.
        </p>

        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

        <p>
            Definitely my emotional intelligence and transitioning further into a growth mindset, I think this bootcamp will help with these. 
        </p>

        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

        <p>
            To give this bootcamp 110%. I really want to put everything and more into this bootcamp to make sure I get through it without any issues.
