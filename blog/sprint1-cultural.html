        <h2>
            The Exploration of my Identity, Values and Strengths
        </h2>

        <p>
           My core personal values would be Justice and Loyality.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Justice" can mean a lot of different things to a lot of people. For me it's about ensurance please receive what is only right.

            A situation where I had to make an ethical decision to make was during a period when I was working for a call centre back in Australia for a company called StarTrack and I was working as a customer service representative. 
            I was dealing with an irate customer who was waiting on their freight that turned out to be medical goods. Because of this we had to contact the depot and urge them to put it out on late delivery, the depot was initially against this due to the difficulty of getting a driver at the time the request was made. 
            Because of the severity of the issue, the call went for much longer then our work KPI (Key Performance Indicator) allowed for. I worked hard to ensure this person got their freight but was still told off for spending 20 minutes calling up the depot and keeping in contact with the customer.  
            I feel comes into one of my values, the sense of Justice, ensuring the customer gets what they need, especially in a scenario where it was medical freight that was desperately needed.

        <h2>
           The Exploration of my Strengths and Limitations
        </h2>

        <p>
            After doing a personality test online, I found that I was ENFP-A. (A Campaigner (ENFP) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. 
            These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.)  
        </p>

        <p>
            This was really eye opening for me as I found out a lot about myself then I expected, especially after researching more about ENFP. This was very apparent looking back when I have done Job interviews and worked in team environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because I am some what extraverted, this has helped me in both situations, however because I have strong sense of feeling; I often would feel self-conscious about things I would say and do. I would do my best to ignore it but sometimes, that feeling gets strong.
        </p>
            Despite this, I love working as a team to tackle a common goal in mind.  An example where I had to work productively with others but there was resistance or tension was back in high school, my team had made it to the finals of a debating competition held within our school. Because of the pressure we had it was a very tense situation trying to devise our debate as a team. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Everyone had their own ideas for the direction they wanted to take the debate. I took a step back and realised we could easily split the ideas into different segments, that would still be structured fine as a debate. 
        So, I advised that we split, write up what we think should be discussed. We then came back later and easily formed it into a great debate. Looking back, I feel this strategy provided the best outcome from the situation where we were not thinking straight. 
        We could have tried to form something there, but because we were not thinking straight initially, I think the outcome would not have been as great.
