            <h2> What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            My long-term goal and career pathway would be to work in the tech industry as a freelancer. 
            Whether it be creating websites, or any other kind of development. 
            I would love to do this while travelling and living in different countries. 
            At some point maybe I would love to teach people about what I have learned in web development.
        </p>

        <h2>Human skills I would live to learn/develop at EDA</h2>

        <p>
            I would like to develop and work on my collaboration skills.  Being able to work as a team is important in this industry, so I would love to see these skills develop, especially with doing the course online,
            it will be an important skill to have developed. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Strengths and limitations</h2>
        
        <p>
            My main strengths are being extroverted and being dependable. As stated in the Cultural 1 blog, because of these strengths I enjoy working in team environments and tackling common goals while helping my peers. 
        </p>

        <p>My main limitation would be my self-confidence, I can sometimes second guess and have self-doubts about something and focus more on my feelings too much rather than thinking about my doubts critically. </p>
        
        <h2>
           EDA course time management
        </h2>

        <p>
            Throughout the rest of the Foundation, I will keep following the timeboxes allocated, as they have kept me focused and motivated. I currently follow the schedule of 9-5 with some more work on the Weekend. I have about an hour break a day; I use this time to reflect on what I’ve learned in my head. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During the bootcamp, I will work as many hours needed for the tasks, I’ll aim for 70 hours a week roughly, but will be prepared to give more time for the task at hand. I’ll aim for about 10 hours work on the weekends too. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            How I will seek help
         </h2>

        <p>
            I’ll seek help by either asking fellow students in the slack channel or searching the internet for the issue I’m having as this has proven fruitful constantly. I’d check google before addressing my peers.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Expectations I have for facilitators
         </h2>

        <p>
            I’m happy with the weekly check-ins and if they’re any issues with anything I’m doing wrong, they would give me a heads up.
        </p>
