            Thinking about having a growth mindset really helps give that extra layer I have presistence in my learning. Knowing it's the way I approach and tackle the task at hand and once I overcome the challenge, my knowledge of the subject expands. So, not only does it feel like I've completed a diffcult challenge, I feel like my knowledge on the subject has expanded.
