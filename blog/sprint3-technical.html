        <h2> An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
            Picture HTML as a builder, they're constructing everything on the website, but they have no sense of design whatsoever. CSS is the designer, they work with what HTML has created but gives it class/style.

        <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
        
        <p>
            Think of control flow as the sequence of starting your car. Before the car starts there's a series of sequences that are preformed,  you first turn the ignition, the current then passes through the ignition coil; then the current flows through the primary winding and is directly sent to the contact breaker. etc etc.
            if the car would fail to start in this scenario, this is where loops come into play. A loop is something that will continue to repeat until the condition given is met. In this case when you would turn the ignition, the car would continue to rev until it started.

            <h2>What is the DOM and how would you interact with it</h2>
   
        <p>
            The  Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content. 
        </p>

        <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>

        <p>
            Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can store a collection of data. Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. Arrays are better for creating and storing multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by a numerical position in the list.
        </p>

            <h2>What functions are and why they are useful</h2>

            <p>
                Functions and procedures are the basic building blocks of programs. They are small sections of code that are used to perform a particular task
                They can be used to avoid repetition of commands within the program. If you have operations that are performed in various different parts of the program, then it makes sense to remove the repeated code and create a separate function or procedure that can be called from those places instead. Not only will this reduce the size of your program, but it will make the code easier to maintain, and it will remove the possibility that some of the code segments are updated, but not others.
